<p className='my-2'>In February 2024, I completed a one-month internship as a front-end developer at Ace360. During this internship, I honed my skills and gained practical experience in implementing user interfaces using technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like Bootstrap and jQuery. This experience played a pivotal role in shaping my approach to creating user-friendly and responsive web applications."</p>
